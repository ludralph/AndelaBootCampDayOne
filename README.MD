THIS IS THE SOLUTION TO THE BOOTCAMP EXERCISES DAY 1.

Coding Lab 1:
 The first coding lab is an implementation of Data Types in Javascript using Jasmine for TDD. I used switch statement to implement it. The coding lab 1 has a filename of datatypes.js and
 the test script is exercise_one_test.js

 Coding Lab 2:
 The second coding lab is an implementation of min-max using simple
 algorithms to iterate through each array.
 The coding lab 2 has a filename of minmax.js and the test script is
 the exercise_two_test.js file in the spec directory.
